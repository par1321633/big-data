1. Delayed
    promotes parallelize if function can run.
    Eg Execute a function on every list item.

    Important Keywords:
    delayed(function_name)(args)
    compute() -- Call compute method to execute the function.

2. Dask Arrays
    Dask array provides a parallel, larger-than-memory,
     n-dimensional array using blocked algorithms.
     Simply put: distributed Numpy.

    Notice that the dask array computation ran in 4 seconds,
    but used 29.4 seconds of user CPU time.

    The numpy computation ran in 19.7 seconds and used 19.6 seconds of user CPU time.

    Dask finished faster, but used more total CPU time because Dask was able to transparently
    parallelize the computation because of the chunk size.

3. Dask DataFrames
    Pandas is great for tabular datasets that fit in memory.
    Dask becomes useful when the dataset you want to analyze is larger than your machine's RAM

    When computing all of the above, we sometimes did the same operation more than once.
    For most operations, dask.dataframe hashes the arguments,
    allowing duplicate computations to be shared, and only computed once.

    Map Partition :
    We dont have dask support for all the pandas functions/libraries.
    If a method is not available then we need to use map partition method

    Things which are not implemented in dask yet, for many of those cases map partition will help .
